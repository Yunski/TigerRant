Nevertheless, you should keep in mind that programming, like math, can be somewhan binary. When taking it, you'll find out that you're either good at it, or you find it hard to understand. Some attribute this to prior programming experience, but precisely why this binary delineation exists is unclear. At any rate, if you have doubts about whether you'll do well in the course, learning the basics of logic and programming on your own, outside of the class, will give you a good indicator of success. A large part to it is understanding sentencial logic - knowing what Boolean algebra is and how conditional statements work is about half of all there is to programming. Logic is to programming as numbers are to arithmetic.",

This is because 1) Professor Clark is one of the best lecturers I've had and 2) more of your inexperienced friends and engineers will take it then, so you'll get to work together or at least struggle together. Be aware that this class has a huge range in difficulty for different individuals. Although I didn't know anything about programming or COS before this course, I found this class to be very manageable and rewarding. I had friends with similar levels of experience who had to drop the course because it simply wasn't clicking for them.

The Lab TA's are helpful and the regular TA's are helpful too. The grading is tough though because you are compared to people who have been coding their whole lives because everyone has to take this course. Because people come from all different levels, Princeton's most general coding class does go pretty fast because they have to get to things that the coders maybe haven't done before. Keep up with the work; do the websheets and extra practice codes as you learn in addition to the weekly assignments. Overall, I was happy that I took this class even though my grades are terrible compared to people who get 100s on everything and code all the time (and I had to PDF) because I'm coming out with a applicable skill.",

That said, I've heard there are other phenomenal preceptors. Clark is a great lecturer, really engaging and always seeming so excited to teach us from his vast base of knowledge. The assignments aren't as scary as you may think before you take a COS class, and many are actually fun. The written exams are doable but just very long given the 50 minute time.

The assignments don't require much if any problem solving ability and what they really test is how well you can interpret vague and spread out directions. The exams themselves are difficult. The average is a C-, but with assignment grades in (everyone gets 95%+ with hard work), grades average out to a B. The second written exam tested more theory than java (90% theory). I took this course to learn java and increase my problem solving ability, but all I really ended up doing was memorizing random and overly useless facts about computer science theory and circuits. If you want to learn java, learn it online. This class won't help get you a job - increasing your problem solving ability and actually learning how to use java to implement solutions will. If you choose to take this class for fun and a B+ or less will lower your GPA, PDF it.",

But there's SO MUCH support, from a website called Piazza where you can post a question and will most likely get a response from a preceptor in less than 10 minutes. There's also office hours you can go to (every night if you want to) where older COS students can help you with debugging your code. There is also always at least one preceptor hosting office hours from nearly 11 am - 6 or 7 pm at night almost every day. Definitely recommend!",

Programming assignments aren't difficult, expect them to take about 3-5 hours a week, at most. Debugging is annoying, but it's a rite of passage. This semester the class was structured very differently, especially the midterms. Be sure to study very hard for the written exams, as they count for a disproportionate amount of the grade, since they're the only things that actually distinguish between all the really good programmers who take this class.

If you haven't had computer programming before, be prepared to be frustrated not only with the difficulty of the course but also with the apparent ease that those people who have already had 3 years of Java programming in high school have in doing the assignments.  Be careful with the timing of the add-drop period because the first 2 weeks of assignments are very doable introductory things and the 3rd week escalates dramatically in terms of difficulty with the NBody assignment and everything after that.  Keep in mind, all of the previous comments are coming from somebody who obviously struggled in the course--it is actually very well taught and truly exciting when you finally do get programs to work--it's a satisfaction and pride hard to find in any other class work.  The kind of thinking that this course introduces you to is invaluable in the modern-day.  Just be prepared to work hard (and possibly not get the grade you want) if you do decide to take it.",

Take a look at the projects and past exams on the course website, and you'll see what I mean. If you have no programming experience, this course will definitely be challenging, but it's also extremely valuable and if you have any interest in it, take it. It's by no means impossible to get whatever grade you want in this class.\nThe one major piece of advice I would give to anyone taking this class is to consistently watch the lectures throughout the year. They may seem extremely dry (read: sleep inducing) at times, but they are important for the written exams, especially the second one. You don't want to end up like me, realizing the day before there is physically no way to watch all of the lectures before the exam. They're also kinda interesting if you like theory.\nAlso learn to program following the style required for the class! This will save you literally hours every week.",

The intro to programming was somewhat of a review, but the richness and extent of the programming curriculum far exceeded my high school experience. Learning theory and how computers actually work later in the course was also new. And extremely exciting! My major advice would be to make sure to get ahead on lecture videos.

However, the assignments do not feel like busywork and are designed to focus on important concepts. You get to choose how much you want out of this class because it offers a wealth of resources from which you can pick those you want to use. I watched the lecture videos and did the textbook readings every week to stay caught up new material, but many students only watch the lecture videos and do really well. My advice is to gauge which of the resources would be most useful for your learning early on in the semester so that you can be efficient with your time. Also, definitely go to office hours if you ever need help on assignments or exam preparation. \n\nWhether you are an aspiring programmer or simply want to understand the technology we use every day, take this course!",

The weekly programming assignments are due on Monday nights at midnight, and it's easy to put them off until Sunday. Try not to do this. It makes for a bad start to your week, and it's more challenging to get help. Schedule office hours because the teaching staff are seriously some of the best instructors at the University and they are always willing to help you. Also, be disciplined in keeping up with lectures if you decide to take the course. Falling behind makes preparation for the written examinations challenging. Definitely more work than your typical PDF course, but also worth it.",

At first the course will seem overwhelming but stick with it and eventually you will get a grip on it. Make sure to either read the textbook/book site pages or watch the lecture videos. Attend the class meetings that are about the weekly programming assignments - they are super helpful. And skip the others unless they are about something that you are struggling with.

Aim to get all the points on the programming assignments (I always started it the weekend before it was due and was able to do it). Practicing coding is important for the exams! At least a day or two before go through as many of the previous exams as possible. The written exams are more theory / computer logic. Watch the lecture and do past assignments.

Having 126 on resume will not only open up a bunch of doors to you (that would otherwise be closed without comp sci bacmkground), but it will also make you seem more valuable to your employer. Finally, this class is CHILL: while I acknowledge that a few students struggle, almost everyone I know thought this was their easiest course. Heck ? I took this with 4 other workload intensive classes during freshman fall and did just fine. If you haven't ever written code before, the first three weeks might be a bit challenging, but from there is is all downhill. If you're having second thoughts, just remember: cos 126 is FUN, VALUABLE, and CHILL. If there is one class everyone at Princeton really ought to take, it is this one!",

I would recommend this class to those who are going to be doing a lot of programming in the future. Also if you want to be a more serious programmer. However, if you are someone who enjoyed 126, take 226 first, then decide if this class is right for you because it is a harder than 226. Lectures are helpful but not entirely necessary. If you want to stay up to date with the material, the lectures are far better than the books. You 100% need to go to precepts. Precepts are where you will learn what you need for the assignments. Also, precepts are way more code based than the lectures. Thus, for someone who is more interested in programming than theory, the precepts are solid. I had Dondero and he is a very good preceptor. He explains everything very well and talks about the assignments in precept, sometimes even giving hints. The assignments are hard, start very early. Learn how to use gdb early. It will help for assignments 1-3. Try to be as careful as possible when writing your code because sometimes the problem can come down to missing one letter and it could take 5 hours to find the bug. They are incredibly difficult to debug. While lab ta's are definitely helpful, they generally aren't very well prepared for helping on 217 assignments. Assembly and heap manager are hard assignments. For the exams, first look at the past exams that your professor has given out. For example, I had Pai and his previous tests were Spring 2010 and 2012. The exams have an enormous amount of variation from professor to professor. So find the ones from your professor's years then practice those. Read the systems book for the final exam, it will help a lot, depending on who your professor is. \nI took 226 with 217 and it is doable. If you decide to take them at the same time you have to work ahead. At first, the two classes together are manageable. However, later in the semeste",

Exams are not like the assignments, so be sure to do a lot of reading of the textbook and try and remember even things that may seem superfluous or that you'd be able to look up on the man pages. Make friends in precept so you can get a good partner for buffer overrun and heap manager.

Some of the assignments may seem overwhelming, but the latter ones are pretty straightforward.

Professor Dondero has this way of teaching the material that makes it not only engaging and interesting, but really quite enjoyable as well.

Also (and this really pertains to all assignments), absolutely start the final shell assignment EARLY. It's an extremely time-consuming project but so rewarding in the end when you get it. I'd also say that you should gauge how comfortable you are with programming and know for yourself how long you need for assignments, because everyone works at a different pace for this kind of thing, so do what works for you and not for other people.

The point of this course is, according to him, learn about larger scale programming, and to that end it is excellent. The material is a little less interesting than 226 (and not very useful for things like coding interviews) but is important nonetheless. Take it!",

It's not as astronomical of a time commitment as everyone says it is (approximately 10-20 hours/ 1.5 weeks) and the material is easier to understand and more interesting. 217 really goes into the low levels of the machine and you get to understand assembly and machine language as well. Don't be deterred by the infamous seg faults -- they don't actually happen as often as everyone says. The final shell assignment did take as long as the rumors, and I can't even imagine how terrible that must be in the spring when there isn't time during break to finish, but when you finally run ish for the last time and see a (minimally) complete implementation of a shell, that is just the most amazing feeling. Overall, one of the more enjoyable cos classes I've taken here, and easily better than 226.",

Also, if any of you are wondering, taking this class at the same time as COS 226 is doable, so don't rule it out right away!",

Dondero knows the assignments inside and out and is devoted to helping you understand the course material better. It won't be the end of the world if you don't have him (you can always ask him questions on Piazza, which he will respond to in minutes, impressively). Start your assignments early. Don't underestimate how long they will take. Precepts are more important than lectures.

The sunday excersises are incredibly annoying as you pretty much have to get 30/30 on every exercise, which can take 3-5 hours. However, these excersises do keep you up to date with the algorithms. When doing the assignments, read through the assignment page, checklist, and watch the videos. If you need help, go to Lab TA hours, but you should be fine. Most of the assignments are pretty straight forward. Code and test one step at a time and you will be fine. Debugging in this class is pretty straight forward, identify what is going wrong, where is it going wrong, how is it going wrong. If you do this you will be fine. If you code a little, test a little you can catch bugs early. For the midterm and exam take as many practice tests as possible. However focus on the more recent ones as some of the material on older exams may be outdated.  Learn how to trace through the algorithms that show up on those exams. Practice design questions like crazy. I took 226 with 217 and it is doable. If you decide to take them at the same time you have to work ahead. At first the two classes together are manageable. However, later in the semester the assignment deadlines start to overlap. 226 takes less time than 217, but you get less late days for 217. If you are someone who codes at the last minute, don't take these two classes together. You will also be coding/debugging a lot if you take these two classes together. If this is not something you enjoy, don't take these two together. These two classes took up the majority of my semester. If you are planning on taking them together, take them will really easy classes to make the",

Kevin Wayne is a good instructor who really knows his stuff and tries to make the material very clear. Lectures can be boring and you can learn them on your own but I would still suggest going because of interview questions and it's generally helpful to hear it explained from an expert. Jeremie Lumbroso is a great preceptor. He's funny and a bit awkward (european though, so you never know if it's just a culture thing) but he really gets to know everyone in the class and teaches very well.

If you breathe COS, you might not need to read. Don't underestimate the annoying & helpful Blackboard exercises. They often take more than an hour to get a typo-free full-credit score.

Being able to just pause a lecture and re-watch an animation, stare at a code snippet for a while, or listen to Sedgewick's explanation again is unbelievably helpful. Also, the flipped lecture videos are tremendously helpful for reviewing for exams (navigating through organized sections of named videos is way easier than paging through the 900  page textbook).

However, this class is much, much harder than 217 (though not necessarily more time-consuming), contrary to popular belief, because it requires a lot more thinking and analysis and optimization -- which does not have to be a bad thing, except for the fact that there are a million and one different data structures, each with their own best and worst case running times, and then another million algorithms with obscure names, each with their own best and worst running times. Lectures are dry and relatively useless. Expect about 8 hours/week on assignments and another hour for exercises, which are the single thing that motivates students to learn the material at all before exams. Don't take this.

Personally for me, 11:00 in the morning after running up to McCosh does not quite work for me (esp. when my previous class runs late and have assignments due at 10:00 in the morning), so looking back on it, I liked taking the flipped lecture. I also went to normal precept the first week and just answered questions and I was kinda bored for part of the time (even with coming late), so I would say that this was the best choice for me. If prof. Gunawardena is teaching the class then it may be a bit more bumpy then it need be, but I still think that the negatives are outweighted by the postives.\n\nI would recommend looking at the old exams to get a feel for the exams, since I feel that they do not change too much each year though they are technically different.\nI don't know if you need to buy the book. I hardly spent an hour in it, though I was in the flipped lecture so I could always refer to the videos/lecture slides/booksite.",

The coding assignments are sometimes difficult to start without the Thursday class meeting but try your best to start early so that you have late days if you get busy later. Choose your partner for coding assignments extremely carefully ? it is often best to work alone. AVOID Maia for precept. Don't be afraid to skip COS 126 and take this course if you can ? just interview with the placement officer in the COS department and he or she will tell you whether it's realistic.

The assignments in the beginning before the project begins are all pretty interesting (though some are a pain to figure out), but it's not anything that you wouldn't learn by building an app by your own or at a hackathon. The class is a decent amount of work (more than average, I'd say), so don't underestimate the amount of time you're willing to put in. However, if you want to learn a survey about all of the different languages and concepts out there (and not work on your 333 project in lecture instead), Brian Kernighan does a good job of explaining what they all are--you just won't necessarily get practice with them all on a weekly basis.

I feel that the course could be greatly improved by actually teaching us some web-dev, or having web-dev based projects in the first half of the course. Right now, 333 breaks down into two types of groups: people who come in knowing how to do web-development and who make a stellar looking project; and people without a ton of web-dev experience who are frustrated the class doesn't really teach you anything about web-dev.

The value is not so much in learning how to program an app as in working with a team on an extended project. Thrown into that type of environment helps you develop important skills like task management, conflict resolution, and work delegation. The lectures for the course seem a bit disconnected but Kernighan is insightful and hilarious. The guest lectures were awesome (we had Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C  , our year). I wouldn't say that this course really teaches app development but instead throws you into an environment where you have to figure a lot of things out on your own. If you are excited by that challenge, then I highly recommend taking it.",

The second half of the semester is the design project, where you...design your own project with a team. This is a really great learning chance for you to teach yourself new things and use them on a project simultaneously, whether it's building a web app or a mobile app. You also get to experience what it feels like working in a team and contributing code to one large project!

Watch out, graders often make mistakes. - I really liked Prof. Charikar as a lecturer. Some lectures were mindblowing. - Trickier than some upper-level math classes I've taken. Less formalism, more cleverness required. - Ask questions in lecture! - Learn probability well. That's most of what we cover, and it keeps coming up. - Having a solid pset group made my life so much better. - Two take-home midterms and a take-home 36-hour final. - Shiva Kintali is a good preceptor.

Topics like graph theory, NP-completeness, computability, and probability form the basis of theoretical computer science. To gain an appreciation for the achievements in research up to this point, it's necessary to take a course like this one, and 340 is all that we have for an introductory level. Having said that, it was hands down the most difficult class I've ever taken. I had never done a proof before (unless you count the two-column proofs from high school geometry) and the topics were all completely new. The course progressed at a rapid pace and there was almost no sense of building on past material. I never felt prepared for the problem sets, which often fell into the category of \"you see the trick or you don't\". The problem sets took me around 25 hours per week. Our year, it felt like the course staff was against us, publishing unfavorable curves and always looking for mistakes in our proofs rather than trying to give us points for what we did correctly. It seemed like the instructors were out of touch with how difficult the course was for someone who had never done a proof before. It's almost impossible to fulfill the theory requirement without this course, so there's really nothing else to say. I would give advice on how to prepare, but I don't have an answer for that. If you've taken upper level math at Princeton, I guess this course could be easy for you, as indicated by some of the comments I heard throughout the semester. Otherwise, anticipate that this will be your semester's most difficult class and leave enough time for it.",

Seriously, go read the CLRS textbook - you'll see his name every couple of pages (on OCW, the MIT professor asks students to guess who new algorithms were invented by, and the answer is always Tarjan).\n\nTarjan is one of the greatest living theoreticians in computer science, and his expertise shines through the course.  Lectures drag, but he is a fantastic teacher in office hours.\n\nThe course will require all the work in the world, but it'll be worth it.  I'd do it again.

There are a few psets that are no collaboration but they are easier than the rest. The final problem set (more of a take-home exam) is no collaboration and takes a lot of time to complete. Like 340, only 3 to a group were allowed.  This was one of my 5 classes this semester, and it was very doable.  Don't wait till senior year (when you're lazy) to take this class.",

Coming in, I did not feel very comfortable with the class after COS 340; however, I feel like I really learned a lot and that this was a valuable experience. The problem sets are also really nice because we were given more than a week to complete them, which actually gave enough time to really think about the problems and come up with solutions. If you need another theory course, I would recommend this - the material I learned probably will be useful later on, particularly some of the algorithm design tricks.",

The readings helped to stay afloat, but the only way to do well on the problem sets was to have had previous experience with statistics and data analysis.\nThe problem sets were disjointed and used multiple different notations that we hadn't seen in lecture. When the problems were ambiguously phrased (which was often), instructors would give conflicting answers on Piazza as to which interpretation was correct. The problem sets were universally handed back way too late, and there was essentially 0 feedback on the open-ended section (50% of the grade). This was especially problematic because there was also essentially 0 instruction on what we should do for the open-ended section.\nI had hoped that I would get a solid introduction to data analysis and machine learning. I had hoped that I would understand the algorithms we were taught. Instead, I learned the names of different functions in Sci-Kit Learn and got a vague sense of what type of data each technique is usually applied to.",

At other schools, I think the machine learning courses are more applied.  Assignments consisted of a set of tough theory problems, plus an \"open-ended\" problem of the form, \"take something we learned in class and apply it to a data set.\"  These were *really* fun to do.

I wonder what happened this time around that made things so much worse than previous offerings.\n\nBlei is hilarious and makes lectures a lot of fun.  He's also incredibly bright.  That alone might get him good reviews this time around, as it has in the past.  However, the organization of the course this time around was terrible, and absolutely must be improved.\n\nProblem sets were roughly biweekly, and had to be handed in in class just like the annoyingly trivial reading responses (most of which are not read by the course staff) since apparently none of the TAs have mastered email submission of assignments.  \n\nThe restrictiveness of having to be physically in class to submit homework is somewhat eased by \"late days.\"  However, this highlights another problem with the class.  The material required to complete the problem sets was frequently not taught until near, or even after, the due date.  When emailed about these situations, Blei responded by asking not to be emailed about these situations.  He frequently had no idea what material was being covered in the problem sets at any given time, and explicitly said in class that his relationship to the homework was \"fast and loose\" as though that somehow makes everything ok.  This was only made worse by his frequent (still entertaining) tangents in class that delayed covering necessary material even more. (Also, as a courtesy to anyone who takes this class in the future, please save questions that are obviously outside the scope of what we need to know for after class - some students *frequently* asked esoteric questions on which Blei spent a great deal of time at the expense of examinable material.  Some students were so notorious that I heard people were actually playing drinking games in class, one drink per question from a particular student.) Consequently, students were often left with no choice but to use late days just to give the staff time",

I wouldn't exactly call this class disorganized, but the distance between the lecture material and the programming assignments made it so neither one was at all useful. I was fortunate to come into the class with a good operational knowledge of Python, which made the programming assignments just a matter of importing a few libraries and then running a few out-of-the-box algorithms. There wasn't really any kind of engineering challenge, and it much of the work on the assignments was filled with what I'd call \"academic overhead\" (Things like doing research for related work or other background research)\n\nThe course puts a large burden on the student to make their own way through the programming assignments. The TA's and professors care about the course, which is somewhat of a saving grace. But I do not think that I learned anything substantive that  I would not have gotten from reading random online tutorials on my own. This course felt more like a Coursera class than a Princeton class. \n\nDon't just take this class because you feel like you ought to learn about machine learning. You would probably get a similar experience just reading about things on your own, and not dealing with the seemingly unrelated tasks that this class saddles you with. (Notwithstanding the litany of superior ML-focused classes offered here) Given the interest level of the instructors and some of the framework, this class has the potential to be a good course, if it makes serious structural changes to integrate the assignments and lecture material together. At this point, the assignments are pretty much non-instructive, and this is a class that I would recommend that you stay away from, unless you have a serious desire to hound the professors/TA's to get something meaningful out of the class. I doubt you will get anything without extraordinary effort.",

The first programming assignment took 20  hours and required a lot of code to be written, but the time you are given to complete the project is adequate. You also learn a lot from figuring out how to write filters for image processing. After that, I felt that I was learning less because a decent chunk of the code I was writing was implementing pseudocode or mathematical calculations within the code base given to us to complete various features. It's hard to say whether there's an alternative, because the projects are so large that it is necessary for the TAs or professor to have written much of it already. These assignments also took significantly less time than the first one. I probably spent less than 12 hours on each. Definitely recommend it as a good COS class to take though!

He's amazingly good at demystifying topics, and watching him lecture was like watching MTT conduct the SF Symphony in Mahler.

I believe that the heart of this class is in the assignments, which are incredibly interesting. But it's impossible to learn anything when you don't even have an inkling of what you may have done wrong through the semester until the final day. We didn't receive feedback for assignments 3 and 4 until finals week. Even better is the fact that the course staff expected us to understand the first assignment for the midterm exam, and we didn't even receive complete feedback on that assignment until after the exam. \"Feedback\" also amounted to a couple cursory marks that added little clarification (what took so long?). Additionally, office hours were almost essential in order to receive full marks on the assignment. One of the assignments required some reasonably intricate knowledge of Javascript web development that was never covered in the lectures. Although the course staff was very accommodating and \"reactionary\" in dealing with difficult assignments, they clearly did not plan ahead and these assignments just left me confused and frustrated about how I learned nothing. I know many people take this class because of the rave reviews - I've only heard phenomenal things about this course in my time at Princeton. But, unfortunately, this semester fell FAR short of expectations. Avoid if Feamster is teaching or hope that he dramatically changes his approach to this course.",

(This last part may have been the fault of Will Yang, the grad TA in charge of that assignment, who also was extremely slow at grading and gave useless feedback.)  You should also be warned that, as this is a 400-level course, it expects a certain level of experience in the field: many of the assignments draw on knowledge that you'd pick up just in the course of software development / having a general interest in tech (like knowledge of Linux system files / proficiency in working with VMs, knowledge of JQuery, ability to write Python... the last assignment - forensics - is probably substantially harder if you've never used Linux in daily use for an extended period of time).

The prof also tended to do this thing where he would ask who in the class had heard of this or that niche concept, and then not explain that concept very well, or as a student who said they knew what it was to explain it. Either way, this would make you feel awful for not knowing something that others knew (even if it was only a small % of the class) and you would walk out of lecture with only a foggy idea of what the concept was in the first place. It made lecture super demoralizing and so i stopped attending so regularly, as did many others as witness by the size of the class when i did go .

One complaint is that the class was surprisingly easy in some aspects: on a pset, two problems would often be very easy (as in, doable in 10 minutes) and one problem would be very hard (as in, tricky proofs on which I was stuck for 6  hours). Another complaint, which is not the fault of the class, was that crypto is very repetitive. Halfway through you'll realize it's all reductions, all the time; a lot of the proofs and constructions will be similar with slight variations (often involving XOR and hardcore bits); and you spend a lot of time *breaking* schemes rather than constructing new ones. The reductions are not particularly beautiful (do beautiful reductions exist?). So, mathematically, it's not so enlightening. Provable security is a relatively new field though, with interesting assumptions, so it's worth learning.",

Techniques include those for relevance and ranking of documents, exploiting user history, and information clustering. We also examine systems aspects of search technology: how distributed computing and storage are used to make information delivery efficient.",

Topics: games on networks, auctions, mechanism and market design, reputation, computational social choice. The aim of the course is: (1) to understand the game-theoretic issues behind systems involving computation such as online networks, (2) to learn how algorithms and algorithmic thinking can help with designing better decision and allocation mechanisms in an offline world.",

In addition, exams have the same format of cos217 (they are equally, if not more difficult), which I feel requires you to have a thorough knowledge of very obscure details of the course.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that my performance in the course was below average, and I'm sure some students who liked 217 will not agree with my criticisms.

A lot of time is just time is just playing scavenger hunt on stack overflow.\n(2) Mind-reading. Assignments are usually poorly written. In one assignment, there were comments in the provided code that contradicts what the instructions said. When someone asked him on piazza, he said something like, \"oh, the comments are a rough guide only\". And his given code can't even compile, which makes me wonder if he actually bothered to run his code to make sure his assignment actually runs. (I'm looking at you, Arpit Gupta)\n\nWhat you won't learn that much of: Computer Networks.\n\nSure, Professor Feamster has good videos on youtube which cover everything you need to know. His lectures are a different story, usually extremely disorganized. He will say he would cover 3 topics today, but he will spend almost 50 minutes on the first topic, realise he is out of time, then speed through the next two topics faster than a ping to Google.com. And then he'll tell you to watch the videos for stuff he didn't get to cover. So, moral of the story, just don't take the course, and enjoy his youtube videos which teach you everything from the comfort of your living room.",

Get to the core of the concepts and project, and don't stress. There is always more work to do, so don't lock yourself away in the library for a year. You will regret it.

He would never admit that he didn't know the answer to any question, nor did he ever say that any question was intriguing or even at all worthwhile asking. I came into Princeton motivated to do science and thought that ISC would be the place to go. The fall semester proved successful, but the spring semester discouraged me from pursuing science. Of course, I still believe that there is so much in science that is interesting but any interest and enthusiasm I have towards learning science is despite of, rather than because of, the spring semester of ISC.",

Unless the lecture notes are revised for next year, they will probably be pretty useless, at least for your first pass through the material, since they don't explain the material very well or thoroughly (though they're good as a summary or review). Consulting a real textbook instead would probably be helpful (definitely read Griffiths for quantum if you're interested in actually understanding the material!). Unlike last semester, the problems on the exams this semester seemed very different than the problems we did in problem sets or in class; while studying and reviewing the material in preparation for exams is beneficial for your own personal knowledge and learning, it probably won't make a lot of difference in terms of actually preparing you for the exam problems.

You'll learn about waves, which are pretty cool, Fourier transforms, which are useful in many different scientific disciplines, some standard stuff like optics and E&M (which I personally found to be meh), a little fluid dynamics, all the way up to quantum mechanics and how quantum mechanics explains chemistry.

The Prof is really fun and nice, the class is a cool format where you can actually discuss the material in class, and the material is SO COOL. The assigments can be difficult for a sophomore or someone who only has intro-sequence knowledge especially because they don't come with a whole lot of guidance, but I would recommend it if you have taken 226 and 217. If you have only taken 126 this might be a bit too much for you to handle.",

Only take it if you have a genuine interest in MT and NLP, otherwise you won't really enjoy it. Also, even though there are no COS prerequisites, it's wise to at least have some coding experience so that you'll be able to concentrate on building stuff for the assignments rather than trying to learn how to code. And do take advantage of the final project to explore the topics that REALLY interest you- it will be extremely rewarding.",

Machine-learning techniques for processing human languages (morphological analysis, tagging, syntactic and semantic parsing, and  language generation) will be discussed in detail. Linguistic variation across languages and its impact on computational models will be presented. Projects will involve implementing speech/text translation components, identifying their limitations and suggesting improvements.",
