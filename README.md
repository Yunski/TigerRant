# Project Tigershop

## Overview
This project is a dedicated course shopping site for Princeton University.

The minimal viable product includes all the information available on the [course registrar](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/) (course description, meeting times, etc) along with all the information available on the course evaluation pages (overall ratings per semester, professor who taught it, student comments, etc).
