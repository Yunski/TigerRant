# Project Tigershop

## Overview
This project is a dedicated course shopping site for Princeton University.

The goal is provide students with a supplemental information source, such as unfiltered student reviews, an urban dictionary with course descriptions, and a yak-like real-time posting mechanism to keep shoppers and enrolled students up to speed. Students have the option of following courses and getting notifications.

Our website still provides the official course offerings information, but students now have the opportunity to read exclusive content and contribute their own.

We hope that this will make course shopping more fun and informative.
The final feature of our website is a shopping cart that syncs with a user's ReCal calendar.
